# XPeng EV Market Sentiment Analysis System 🚗

### 📖 Project Overview
A data-driven **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tool designed to analyze user feedback for **XPeng Motors (9868.HK)**, specifically focusing on the newly launched **P7+** and **MONA M03** models.

Using **Jieba** for Chinese text segmentation and an **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** approach, this system quantifies user satisfaction across 5 critical product dimensions, providing actionable insights for equity research and product iteration.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically classifies unstructured user comments into structured dimensions:
    * 🧠 **Intelligent Driving:** (e.g., NGP, Parking, AI Hawkeye)
    * 🔋 **Range & Battery:** (e.g., Power consumption, Charging speed)
    * 🛋️ **Space & Comfort:** (e.g., Legroom, NVH, Seat comfort)
    * 🎨 **Design & Interior:** (e.g., Appearance, Material quality)
    * 💰 **Service & Cost:** (e.g., Price-performance ratio, Delivery)
* **Vertical Domain Lexicon:** Built a customized dictionary for EV terminology (e.g., "NGP", "8295 Chip", "CDC", "OTA").
* **Visualization:** Generates **Radar Charts** to visualize the product's competitive landscape at a glance.

### 📊 Market Insights (Sample Analysis)
*(Based on high-fidelity user feedback from Autohome/Dongchedi/Weibo, Nov-Dec 2024)*

* **✅ Competitive Moat:** The **"Intelligent Driving"** and **"Space"** dimensions scored the highest, validating the "AI-Defined Car" strategy of the P7+.
* **⚠️ Pain Points:** User feedback indicates lower satisfaction in **"Space & Comfort"** (specifically regarding **NVH/Tire Noise** and **New Car Odor**), suggesting areas for supply chain optimization.
